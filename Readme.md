## **Objective**

X Education seeks to enhance its lead conversion rate for online courses sold to industry professionals. Currently, only 30% of acquired leads convert. To optimize sales efforts, the company aims to identify "Hot Leads" using a logistic regression model. The model will assign a lead score (0-100) to predict conversion likelihood. A higher score indicates a hotter lead, while a lower score suggests a colder lead. The model should enable the sales team to focus on high-potential leads, increasing conversion rates. Additionally, the model should be adaptable to address future requirements outlined in a separate document.
